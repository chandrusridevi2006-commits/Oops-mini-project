🏨 Hotel Housekeeping Management System

📘 Overview

The Hotel Housekeeping Management System is a Java-based mini project designed to streamline and digitalize housekeeping operations within a hotel environment. The system enables housekeeping staff to record room cleaning activities, update task logs in real time, and display these records through a user-friendly graphical interface.
Developed using Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL, the project demonstrates how object-oriented programming concepts, exception handling, multithreading, and client-server networking can be integrated to build an efficient and reliable hotel management tool.
This project provides supervisors with a centralized interface to view all housekeeping activities, ensuring better coordination, accountability, and transparency in daily hotel operations.

🧩 Key Features

🧹 Record and manage housekeeping activities (e.g., cleaning, restocking, linen replacement).
💾 Real-time data storage and retrieval using MySQL.
🔄 Client–Server communication through Java Sockets.
🧵 Supports Multithreading for parallel housekeeping tasks.
🪟 Interactive Java Swing GUI for viewing housekeeping logs.
✅ Data integrity ensured through prepared statements and input validation.
